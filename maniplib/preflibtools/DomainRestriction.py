# Implement of the Single Peaked Consistancy Algorithm detailed in
# B. Escoffier, J. Lang, and M. Ozturk, "Single-peaked consistency and its complexity".
# 2008 European Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
#
# Intuitivily, this algortihm finds an axis that is single peaked with respect to 
# the rmaps that are passed in, or it returns an empty axis (vector) of the candidates.
# This is achieved in time O(|rmaps|*|candmap|).

# set of rankmaps is passed in, an error is returned.
